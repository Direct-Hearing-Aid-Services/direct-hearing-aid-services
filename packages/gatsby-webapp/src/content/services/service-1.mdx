# What is a Class One Digital and Power Repair?

## Class 1 Digital and Power Repair: An Explanation of this Classification

A hearing aid consists of 2 basic component categories: the shell and
the electronic devices which includes one or more microphones
(transducer) which receive sound waves, a receiver (speaker) which
transmits or projects processed and modified sound, into the ear canal.

Both of these type components are:

- Very susceptible to contamination by dirt, dust, moisture, chemicals (such as hair spray) and ear wax created within the ear canal.
- Contain very delicate membranes which can be damaged by physical shock or environmental factors, including humidity and moisture.
- Some hearing aids include switches and other devices such as a Telescopic (for use with a telephone) and

Such devices are included in this repair classification.

The nature of ear wax, in conjunction with movement, expansion and
contraction of the ear canal, results in the ear wax moving within the
ear canal and getting into parts of the hearing aid, such as the
receiver tube. The slightest amount of such contaminants can obstruct
the passage of sound, and render the hearing aid ineffective.

Another electronic component within the hearing aid is a device called a
capacitor. The manufacturer of the capacitor has a chemical ingredient
which is subject to deterioration over time, and can become defective.

Other components are: resistors, which affect the flow of electrical
current, the amplifier, which is critical to the operation and function
of the hearing aid, and copper wiring which is attached by solder and
connects the components.

Accidental physical abuse, such as dropping a hearing aid on a hard
surface, can dislodge and damage the electronic components. A
malfunction in the tolerances of these components affects the
performance of the hearing aid.

Class 1 Hearing Aid Digital and Power Repair includes the repair or
replacement of any of these electronic components, BUT we maintain the
"original" hearing loss settings inside the Hearing Aid. Within the
warranty period provided with the repair of the hearing aid, all
components and labor are provided regardless of whether they were
functioning according to specification at the time of the initial repair
and were not the cause for the original failure.
