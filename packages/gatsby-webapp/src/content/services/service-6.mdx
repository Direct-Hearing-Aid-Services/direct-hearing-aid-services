      <p>
        We can usually adjust your "current" Hearing Aid to accomodate for
        additional Hearing Loss which will SAVE you money and keep you from
        having to purchase a brand new Hearing Aid. If you are no longer hearing
        well with your Hearing Aid and want to send it to us for repair or
        reprogramming, we will ask you to send a "current" Audiogram (Audiogram
        only good for 6 months) along with your Hearing Aid to our lab for
        hearing aid repair, Orange County so we can adjust your Hearing Aid
        accordingly.

        NOTE: When you send us your Hearing Aid for a Hearing Loss Adjustment,
        you will receive a FREE Clean and Check on your Hearing Aid (valued at
        $49.99)
