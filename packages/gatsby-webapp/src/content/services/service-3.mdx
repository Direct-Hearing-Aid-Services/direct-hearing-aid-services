      <h1>What is Class 3 Hearing Aid Repair?</h1>
      <p> Class 3 Hearing Aid Repair includes the following options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Class 1 (Basic Repair)</li>
        <li>
          Replacement of damge mold (shell) Current Impression needed (Using
          exisiting faceplate and electronics)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        How is this done? A block (usually consisting of cotton or rubber) is
        inserted into the ear canal (including a removal string), and through
        the use of a syringe, the prepared material is injected into the canal
        and concha, allowed time to harden, and is then removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The finished impression is then submitted to an earmold lab which begins
        the process of manufacturing a shell by making a mold of the impression
        and then casting a plastic replica of the ear. This becomes what is
        called the shell of a Custom-Made Hearing Aid.
      </p>
      <p>
        The faceplate is a separate pre-finished plastic part which is then
        bonded to the finished shell. The faceplate, which holds the appropriate
        electronic components including the battery door, microphone and volume
        control, is not custom-made but is modified and adapted to fit the
        custom shell.
      </p>
      <p>
        The placement of all switches or buttons on a Faceplate is critical
        since they have to be operated or activated by the use of a finger and
        it is important that the hearing aid user can find and activate the
        various devices by touch. The Replacement of such switches and devices
        is usually accomplished under the Class 1 Electronic Repair Services.
      </p>

        The faceplate may also have to be replaced due to Physical Damage or
        Abuse, or from the plastic cracking or otherwise being damaged and
        unserviceable. A damaged faceplate prevents the separating and opening
        of the faceplate from the shell, required in all Servicing of the
        Hearing Aid itself.
