# What is inside a hearing aid?

A hearing aid consists of 2 basic component categories - the shell and electronics.

The electronics consists of:
- transducer: microphones which receive sound waves
- speaker: a receiver which processes sound
- capacitors
- resistors
- amplifier
- copper wiring

# What damages hearing aids?
- Contamination of dirt, dust, moisture, chemicals (such as hair spray) and ear wax created within the ear canal
- Accidental physical shock or abuse
- Environmental factors such as humidity and moisture
- Deterioration of capacitors over time
- Deterioration of resistors affecting electrical current

# Other common issues with hearing aids

The nature of ear wax, in conjunction with movement, expansion and
contraction of the ear canal, results in the ear wax moving within the
ear canal and getting into parts of the hearing aid, such as the
receiver tube. The slightest amount of such contaminants can obstruct
the passage of sound, and render the hearing aid ineffective.
