<h1>What is Class 2 Hearing Aid Repair?</h1>
<br />
<b>Class 2 Hearing Aid Repair includes the following ouelet options:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Class 1 (Basic Repair)</li>
  <li>Re-installation of original electronics</li>
  <li>
    Replacement of a Faceplate and battery door because of damage or
    defect
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
  Any of these changes offered are always provided at a much greater
  savings than the purchase of a New Hearing Aid with the same or similar
  benefits.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  When the Faceplate is manufactured, what is called a Hinge Pin, which
  allows for the attachment and functioning of a battery door, is molded
  into the Faceplate. It infrequently becomes dislodged and cannot be
  replaced.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  If the Hinge Pin becomes dislodged or otherwise damaged, such a repair
  involves the complete replacement of the Faceplate.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The faceplate may also have to be replaced due to Physical Damage or
  Abuse, or from the plastic cracking or otherwise being damaged and
  unserviceable.
