      <h1>What is Class 4 Hearing Aid Repair?</h1>
      <br />
      <b> Class 4 Hearing Aid Repair consist of the following options:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Upgrading electronics</li>
        <li>Convert from analog to digital</li>
        <li>Reprogram to current audiogram (Hearing Test)</li>
        <li>Option to change battery size</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Serious consideration should be given to all the options available in
        the event the Faceplate has to be replaced.
      </p>
      <br />
      <b>
        Any time a new faceplate is required, for any reason, it is strongly
        recommended that a current Audiogram (hearing test) be submitted with
        the request for repair services.
      </b>
      <ul>
        <li>An upgrade to the existing analog circuit (more gain)</li>
        <li>
          An upgrade to the existing analog circuit to programmable analog
          signal processing
        </li>
        <li>
          An upgrade to the existing digital circuit to a current digital
          circuit
        </li>
        <li>They choose to because of a change in hearing loss</li>
        <li>
          The desire to make changes or modifications at their discretion for
          improvement, convenience of usage, or better hearing aid performance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        When a New Faceplate is installed, unless otherwise stated, all New
        Electronics are installed, and the only part of the existing hearing aid
        used is the Shell and usually the same serial number.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Installing a new faceplate provides the opportunity to change the
        internal components of like type (either Analog or Digital) to
        compensate or allow for more gain (power) or other features. Features
        such as Switches or Buttons can be added or removed at the time of
        Faceplate replacement.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Usually depending upon availability or costs, the user may choose to
        upgrade the Circuit and Components to allow for changes in the
        performance of the hearing aid through the use of a Computer. The user
        may choose to upgrade the existing hearing aidâ€™s electronics to Digital
        Signal Processing for enhanced benefits to the existing hearing aid. The
        user may also choose to upgrade the existing Digital Circuit for
        improved hearing or tolerance, performance, or for more convenient and
        inexpensive service.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The user, owner, or caretaker, may choose to change an existing private
        label, or brand of hearing aid circuit, because of Limited and
        Non-Competitive Service Availability.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In such an event, the hearing aid user has the option to choose to have
        the existing electronics transferred from the damaged faceplate, and
        reused, or to use this opportunity to upgrade the electronics to either
        different and stronger components (to compensate for a change in hearing
        loss), to add or remove aforementioned Switches and Features, or to
        convert the existing hearing aid to Analog or Digital Signal Processing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Since Brands such as all the major PRIVATE LABELS in the hearing aid
        industry, do not make their PROPRIETY SOFTWARE available to non-member
        Dealers, such hearing aids can only be serviced and programmed by the
        AUTHORIZED FRANCHISE DEALERS and not the GENERAL PUBLIC.
