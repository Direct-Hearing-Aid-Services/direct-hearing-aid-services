    <h2>Choosing A Hearing Aid Repair Lab</h2>
    <h2>Where Should You Have Your Hearing Aid Repaired ?</h2>
    <p>
      This is a question most hearing aid users will have to ask themselves
      sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing aids are hybrids of mechanical and electronic devices. They are
      subject to moisture, dust, dirt, earwax, debris, and physical abuse and
      handling, and at some point in time, will require maintenance and
      possibly, major or minor repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        As a hearing aid user, it is important you understand that the basic
        purpose of hearing aid manufacturers and retail outlets is to
        continually sell you new product.
      </b>{" "}
      Why? That’s how they make the greatest profit, so these companies try to
      deter clients from repairing their hearing aids and instead pressure them
      to buy a new one. This attitude is reflected by many outlets who claim
      they cannot repair even their own brand of hearing aid after a specified
      period of time, such as 3 or 5 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>All hearing aids, standardized or custom-made, can be repaired.</b>{" "}
      Whether you need to fix the microphone, receiver, a broken wire, or a bad
      transistor, it can be repaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>So, who should repair your hearing aid?</b>
      The best source for hearing aid repair is someone that repairs,
      recondition, hearing aids with warranty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>
        An independent hearing aid repair lab is dedicated to providing all the

        <b>
          {" "}
          Class 1 Digital and Power Repair: An Explanation of this
          Classification
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A hearing aid consists of 2 basic component categories: the shell and
        the electronic devices which includes one or more microphones
        (transducer) which receive sound waves, a receiver (speaker) which
        transmits or projects processed and modified sound, into the ear canal.
      </p>
      <p>Both of these type components are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Very susceptible to contamination by dirt, dust, moisture, chemicals
          (such as hair spray) and ear wax created within the ear canal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contain very delicate membranes which can be damaged by physical shock
          or environmental factors, including humidity and moisture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some hearing aids include switches and other devices such as a
          Telescopic (for use with a telephone) and
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Such devices are included in this repair classification.</p>
      <p>
        The nature of ear wax, in conjunction with movement, expansion and
        contraction of the ear canal, results in the ear wax moving within the
        ear canal and getting into parts of the hearing aid, such as the
        receiver tube. The slightest amount of such contaminants can obstruct
        the passage of sound, and render the hearing aid ineffective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another electronic component within the hearing aid is a device called a
        capacitor. The manufacturer of the capacitor has a chemical ingredient
        which is subject to deterioration over time, and can become defective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other components are: resistors, which affect the flow of electrical
        current, the amplifier, which is critical to the operation and function
        of the hearing aid, and copper wiring which is attached by solder and
        connects the components.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accidental physical abuse, such as dropping a hearing aid on a hard
        surface, can dislodge and damage the electronic components. A
        malfunction in the tolerances of these components affects the
        performance of the hearing aid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Class 1 Hearing Aid Digital and Power Repair includes the repair or
        replacement of any of these electronic components, BUT we maintain the
        "original" hearing loss settings inside the Hearing Aid. Within the
        warranty period provided with the repair of the hearing aid, all
        components and labor are provided regardless of whether they were
        functioning according to specification at the time of the initial repair
        and were not the cause for the original failure.
      </p>{" "}
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>What is Class 2 Hearing Aid Repair?</h1>
      <p> Class 2 Hearing Aid Repair includes the following ouelet options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Class 1 (Basic Repair)</li>
        <li>Re-installation of original electronics</li>
        <li>
          Replacement of a Faceplate and battery door because of damage or
          defect
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any of these changes offered are always provided at a much greater
        savings than the purchase of a New Hearing Aid with the same or similar
        benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Faceplate is manufactured, what is called a Hinge Pin, which
        allows for the attachment and functioning of a battery door, is molded
        into the Faceplate. It infrequently becomes dislodged and cannot be
        replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Hinge Pin becomes dislodged or otherwise damaged, such a repair
        involves the complete replacement of the Faceplate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The faceplate may also have to be replaced due to Physical Damage or
        Abuse, or from the plastic cracking or otherwise being damaged and
        unserviceable.
      </p>{" "}
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>What is Class 3 Hearing Aid Repair?</h1>
      <p> Class 3 Hearing Aid Repair includes the following options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Class 1 (Basic Repair)</li>
        <li>
          Replacement of damge mold (shell) Current Impression needed (Using
          exisiting faceplate and electronics)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        How is this done? A block (usually consisting of cotton or rubber) is
        inserted into the ear canal (including a removal string), and through
        the use of a syringe, the prepared material is injected into the canal
        and concha, allowed time to harden, and is then removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The finished impression is then submitted to an earmold lab which begins
        the process of manufacturing a shell by making a mold of the impression
        and then casting a plastic replica of the ear. This becomes what is
        called the shell of a Custom-Made Hearing Aid.
      </p>
      <p>
        The faceplate is a separate pre-finished plastic part which is then
        bonded to the finished shell. The faceplate, which holds the appropriate
        electronic components including the battery door, microphone and volume
        control, is not custom-made but is modified and adapted to fit the
        custom shell.
      </p>
      <p>
        The placement of all switches or buttons on a Faceplate is critical
        since they have to be operated or activated by the use of a finger and
        it is important that the hearing aid user can find and activate the
        various devices by touch. The Replacement of such switches and devices
        is usually accomplished under the Class 1 Electronic Repair Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The faceplate may also have to be replaced due to Physical Damage or
        Abuse, or from the plastic cracking or otherwise being damaged and
        unserviceable. A damaged faceplate prevents the separating and opening
        of the faceplate from the shell, required in all Servicing of the
        Hearing Aid itself.
      </p>{" "}
    </div>
    <div>
      <h1>What is Class 4 Hearing Aid Repair?</h1>
      <p> Class 4 Hearing Aid Repair consist of the follong options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Upgrading electronics</li>
        <li>Convert from analog to digital</li>
        <li>Reprogram to current audiogram (Hearing Test)</li>
        <li>Option to change battery size</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Serious consideration should be given to all the options available in
        the event the Faceplate has to be replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any time a new faceplate is required, for any reason, it is strongly
        recommended that a current Audiogram (hearing test) be submitted with
        the request for repair services.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An upgrade to the existing analog circuit (more gain)</li>
        <li>
          An upgrade to the existing analog circuit to programmable analog
          signal processing
        </li>
        <li>
          An upgrade to the existing digital circuit to a current digital
          circuit
        </li>
        <li>They choose to because of a change in hearing loss</li>
        <li>
          The desire to make changes or modifications at their discretion for
          improvement, convenience of usage, or better hearing aid performance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When a New Faceplate is installed, unless otherwise stated, all New
        Electronics are installed, and the only part of the existing hearing aid
        used is the Shell and usually the same serial number.
      </p>
      <p>
        Installing a new faceplate provides the opportunity to change the
        internal components of like type (either Analog or Digital) to
        compensate or allow for more gain (power) or other features. Features
        such as Switches or Buttons can be added or removed at the time of
        Faceplate replacement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually depending upon availability or costs, the user may choose to
        upgrade the Circuit and Components to allow for changes in the
        performance of the hearing aid through the use of a Computer. The user
        may choose to upgrade the existing hearing aid’s electronics to Digital
        Signal Processing for enhanced benefits to the existing hearing aid. The
        user may also choose to upgrade the existing Digital Circuit for
        improved hearing or tolerance, performance, or for more convenient and
        inexpensive service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user, owner, or caretaker, may choose to change an existing private
        label, or brand of hearing aid circuit, because of Limited and
        Non-Competitive Service Availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such an event, the hearing aid user has the option to choose to have
        the existing electronics transferred from the damaged faceplate, and
        reused, or to use this opportunity to upgrade the electronics to either
        different and stronger components (to compensate for a change in hearing
        loss), to add or remove aforementioned Switches and Features, or to
        convert the existing hearing aid to Analog or Digital Signal Processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Brands such as all the major PRIVATE LABELS in the hearing aid
        industry, do not make their PROPRIETY SOFTWARE available to non-member
        Dealers, such hearing aids can only be serviced and programmed by the
        AUTHORIZED FRANCHISE DEALERS and not the GENERAL PUBLIC.
